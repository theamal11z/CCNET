# CampusConnect Development Master Plan

## Core Concept
**Pseudonymous Academic Social Platform** connecting:
- Prospective students ↔ Verified current students
- Alumni ↔ Faculty
- Cross-institution academic communities

### Key Differentiators
1. Identity-protected interactions
2. College-verified user system
3. Academic-focused content ecosystem
4. Secure peer-to-peer mentoring

## Current Status (Phase 1.5)
```progress

```
**Completed:**
- Expo + Supabase foundation
- Basic auth flows
- Profile schema design
- Initial forum components

**Immediate Next:**
1. Finish auth-zustand integration
2. Complete profile editing system
3. Implement college verification MVP
4. Optimize post rendering performance

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------------|
| Verification Abuse | Document hashing + Manual review |
| Content Moderation | Hybrid AI/Human system |
| Network Effects | College ambassador program |
| Data Privacy | Regular third-party audits |
| Performance | Progressive loading + Edge caching |

## Quality Assurance Plan

1. **Testing Layers**
   - Unit: Core utilities
   - Integration: Auth flows
   - E2E: User journeys

2. **Load Testing**
   - Concurrent verification requests
   - High-density chat rooms
   - Search performance

3. **User Testing**
   - Prospective student cohort
   - College admin group
   - Alumni panel
```

This plan synthesizes requirements from:
- User identity needs (`userstuff.md`)
- Technical roadmap (`planCCNetDEv.md`)
- Immediate next steps (`nextstep.md`)
- Current codebase status

Would you like me to create any specific implementation guides from this plan?
