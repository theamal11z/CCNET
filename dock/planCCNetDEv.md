# CampusConnect Development Plan

## Project Overview
A pseudonymous social platform connecting prospective students with verified current students. Built with React Native, Expo, Supabase, and Zustand.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - `Create Expo project with TypeScript template`
  - `Configure Supabase client`
  - `Install dependencies: react-native-paper, zustand, react-query`
  
- [ ] **Authentication System**
  - `Implement social login flows (Google/Facebook)`
  - `Create username reservation system`
  ```plaintext
  Prompt: Build a username validation service that checks availability in real-time during registration
  ```

### Phase 2: User Identity & Verification (Week 3-4)
- [ ] **Pseudonymous Profile System**
  - `Secure storage setup for real user data`
  - `Public profile interface development`
  
- [ ] **College Verification Flow**
  - `ID upload component with image cropping`
  - `Live photo capture implementation`
  ```plaintext
  Prompt: Create a document upload component with automatic file type detection and size validation
  ```

### Phase 3: Core Features (Week 5-7)
- [ ] **Forum System**
  - `Twitter-style feed with infinite scroll`
  - `College-specific post filtering`
  ```plaintext
  Prompt: Implement a feed that mixes general posts with college-specific content based on user verification status
  ```

- [ ] **College Database**
  - `Searchable college directory`
  - `Detail pages with statistics and reviews`

### Phase 4: Communication Features (Week 8-9)
- [ ] **Real-time Chat**
  - `General public chat room`
  - `College-specific private channels`
  ```plaintext
  Prompt: Create message moderation middleware that scans for sensitive content before storage
  ```

### Phase 5: Reward System & Moderation (Week 10-11)
- [ ] **Engagement Tracking**
  - `Like/comment analytics dashboard`
  - `we add a reward system later`

- [ ] **Admin Panel**
  - `Content moderation interface`
  - `Verification review system`
  - `super admin dashboard`
  - `control over the post and user data , chats , etc`
  - `able to add and edit colleges , categories , etc`

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment (Week 12)
- [ ] **Quality Assurance**
  - `End-to-end testing for verification flow`
  - `Load testing for chat system`

- [ ] **Deployment Prep**
  - `App store provisioning`
  - `Supabase production configuration`

## Development Strategy

1. **Modular Development**
   - Build features as independent packages:
   ```plaintext
   Prompt: Create a feature-based directory structure with separate modules for auth, forum, chat, and verification
   ```

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with core forum functionality
   - Add verification requirements incrementally

3. **Privacy-First Approach**
   - Implement data encryption from initial stages
   ```plaintext
   Prompt: Set up automatic encryption for all user-sensitive data fields in Supabase
   ```

## Milestone Checklist
| Feature                | Est. Time | Priority |
|------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Auth System            | 5 days    | Critical |
| Forum Base              | 7 days    | High     |
| Verification Flow       | 6 days    | High     |
| College Database        | 4 days    | Medium   |
| Chat System             | 8 days    | High     |
| Reward Mechanism        | 5 days    | Medium   |

## Cursor AI Integration Plan
1. Use `/test` command for critical path verification
2. Implement code suggestions for repetitive patterns
3. Use chat for:
   - Complex state management solutions
   - Supabase edge cases
   - Performance optimization

## Risk Management
- **Data Privacy**: Regular security audits
- **Content Moderation**: Implement automated filtering early
- **Scale**: Stress test chat system during development
